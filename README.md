Detecting Cardiac Ailments with Synchro-squeezing wavelet transform and attention based transformer
ABSTRACT:
Abstract—Atrial fibrillation (AF) based cardiac disease is
interpreted based on the appearance of abnormal atrial activity
and irregular inter-beat duration in the electrocardiogram (ECG)
signal. The sustained AF episodes are more likely to develop
severe cardiac disorders such as cardiomyopathy and myocardial
infarction. Therefore, AF detection at an early stage using
ECG signals is challenging in clinical standards to monitor
the progression of this pathology. In this article, a novel timefrequency (TF) domain deep learning approach is proposed for
the automated detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) using multilead ECG signals. The wavelet-based synchrosqueezing transform
(WSST) is used to evaluate the TF image of each lead ECG
signal. Furthermore, the modified vision transformer (ViT) model
detects AF arrhythmia using the WSST-based TF images of
the three best lead ECG signals. The proposed approach is
tested using a public database’s multi-lead ECG time series.
The results reveal that the suggested WSST-based modified ViT
model has obtained the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-
score values of 95.50%, 93.36%, 98.00%, and 0.957, respectively.
Compared to TF images of other lead ECG signals, the WSSTbased TF images of lead II ECG signals yielded the ViT model
an accuracy value of 94.50%. To detect AF using multi-lead
ECG signals, the proposed approach outperformed continuous
wavelet transform (CWT) and short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) domain convolutional neural network (CNN) models in
terms of classification performance.
